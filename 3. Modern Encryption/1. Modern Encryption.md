## **Stream Ciphers: Overview and Objectives**

Stream ciphers represent an important class of cryptographic algorithms. Unlike block ciphers, which encrypt data in fixed-size blocks, stream ciphers encrypt individual bits of plaintext sequentially. This section aims to introduce:

- The basics of modulo 2 arithmetic and Exclusive-OR (XOR) operations.
    
- Concepts and classification of stream ciphers.
    
- The strengths and weaknesses of stream cipher methods.
    
- Fundamentals of random and pseudorandom number generation.
    
- The theoretically unbreakable cipher known as the One-Time Pad (OTP).
    

## Modulo Arithmetic:
 - [[Modulo Artihmetic]].

## XOR
- [[XOR Operation]]


## Key Stream

- EVERYTING depends on the keystream.
- [[Key Stream]].


## [[Stream Ciphers]]


## [[One-Time Pad]]



## **Practical Security: Computational Security**:

1. Unlike OTP, Â most practical cryptographic systems are not unconditionally secure but computationally secure, meaning no known feasible algorithm exists to break the encryption within a reasonable timeframe
2. Modern Stream Ciphers achieve computational security through CSPRNGs.


## Pros and Cons of Stream Ciphers:

1. Efficient, lower computational resource usage, suitable for devices with constrained environments.
2. Vulnerable to implementation errors and weakness if keystream is compromised.

## RC4 Stream Cipher:
- Developed by Ronald Rivest (RSA Security).
- RC4 generates pseudorandom bytes from a key-initialized 256-byte state table XORed with plaintext.
- no longer secure due to vulnerabilities discovered over time.
