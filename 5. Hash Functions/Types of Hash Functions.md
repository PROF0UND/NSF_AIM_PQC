1. **Dedicated Hashes (e.g., [[MD4]], SHA‑2, SHA‑3, [[SHA Family]]):** Built directly as compression functions processing blocks.
    
2. **Block Cipher‑Based Hashes:** Use existing block ciphers (AES/DES) in specialized modes (e.g., Davies–Meyer) to derive hash functions. Each design balances performance, security proofs, and flexibility.
