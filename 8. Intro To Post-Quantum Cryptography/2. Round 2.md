- 26 candidates studied
- NIST held second PQC conference Aug 2019
- teams optimized implementations, and projects like **Open Quantum Safe** published benchmarking results for algorithms on various platforms.

## Notable Developments:

1. [[Lattice-based]]:
	1. Kyber, Saber, NTRU - excellent performance
	2. FrodoKEM was slow and large keys but remainend
	3. qTESLA had issues and dropped
2. [[code-based]]:
	1. McEliece kept its reputation
	2. BIKE and HQC faced some attacks but survived.
	3. a minor security concern on BIKE’s decoding led to tweaks.
	4. code-based signature attempts (like **PQDSS**) were out because they were too impractical.
3. [[multivariable polynomial]]:
	1. Rainbow and GeMSS were still intact.
	2. LUOV was attacked and had to adjust.
	3. very large key sizes was a downside.
4. [[isogeny-based]]:
	1. SIKE _looked_ solid but slow
5. [[hash-based]]:
	1. [[SPHINCS+]] was tuned 
	2. Picnic was advanced 
	3. its “MPC-in-head” proof approach, while secure, meant huge signatures (tens of KB).
	4. became clear Picnic wouldnt outperform [[SPHINCS+]]

---
- End of round 2: NIST IR 8309 (Status report of the 2nd round)
- [[3. Round 3]] finalists.
- those ready for standardization.
- all **three KEM finalists** except McEliece were lattice-based (Kyber, Saber, NTRU)
- lattice schemes dominated in performance.
- signatures, two lattice (Dilithium, Falcon) and one multivariate (Rainbow) were finalists.
- Alternates were algorithms that NIST found promising but perhaps not as immediately appealing.
- [[SPHINCS+]] had long keys
- SIKE was alternate because, while interesting, it was slower and new
- NTRU Prime was seen as a backup in case something was wrong with NTRU
