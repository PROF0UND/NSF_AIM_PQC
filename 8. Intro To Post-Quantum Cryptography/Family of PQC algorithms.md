- PQC comes with a variety of mathematical problems unlike RSA/ECC

---
## Five Major Families:

1. [[Lattice-based]]
2. [[code-based]]
3. [[multivariable polynomial]]
4. [[hash-based]]
5. [[isogeny-based]]

---
## Other Approaches:

1. [[Symmetric or Zero Knowledge-Based Signatures]]
2. Others:
	1. hybrid schemes (e.g., **NTRU Hybrid** that mixed lattice and codes, etc.)

---

- Lattice-based algorithms emerged as big winners due to their strong security and practicality
- code-based algorithms remain as strong backups
- hash-based signatures provide a conservative safety net
- and other approaches like multivariate and isogeny, while conceptually promising, encountered setbacks (attacks) during the evaluation.
