- 82 algorithms were submitted.
- 69 algorithms met NIST criteria.
- very diverse pool:
1. [[Lattice-based]]:
	1. Kyber
	2. Saber
	3. NTRU
	4. FRodoKEM (a conservative lattice scheme without using cyclotomic structure)
	5. Dilithium
	6. Falcon
	7. qTESLA (signatures)
	8. many others with creative names (Round1 lattice submissions had names like LAC, Titanium, Ding Key Exchange, etc.)
	9. a scheme named **SOLMAE** was found insecure early
2. [[code-based]]:
	1. classic McEliece
	2. LEDACrypt
	3. BIKE
	4. HQC
	5. NTS-KEM
	6. many other tried to reduce key sizes
3. [[multivariable polynomial]]:
	1. Rainbow
	2. Gui
	3. Pie
	4. GeMSS
	5. LUOV (variant of UOV)
	6. Rainbow and GeMSS held up initially
4. [[hash-based]]:
	1. [[SPHINCS+]]
	2. stateless hash based entry
5. [[isogeny-based]]:
	1. SIKE
6. Others:
		1. Picnic (symmetric/zk-based signature)
		2. some hybrid schemes - LEDACrypt (code+multivar).

- [[RSA]] type and [[Diffie‑Hellman Key Exchange]] type failed.
- some lattice, multivar  schemes broken
- SRTPI (isogeny + symmetric) was withdrawn.
- By the end of Round 1, NIST, with community input, chose 26 algorithms for **Round 2**​: 17 KEMs and 9 signatures.
