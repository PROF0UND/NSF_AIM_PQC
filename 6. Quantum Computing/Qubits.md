### Classical bit:
- can only represent 0 or 1.
- a register of n bits can represent one of $$2^n$$ states at a time.
---
### Qubit
- A qubit in superposition looks like a flipping coin.
- represents 0 and 1.
- this is superposition ([[Quantum Mechanics Foundations]]).
- a register of n qubits can be $$2^n$$ different states.
