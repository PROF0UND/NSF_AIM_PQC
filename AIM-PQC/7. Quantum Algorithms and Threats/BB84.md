Famous QKD protocol

## Workflow:

1. Alice sends Bob a series of photons, each polarized in one of several possible bases (e.g., rectilinear + or diagonal × polarization, representing bits 0/1 in two different ways). She keeps track of how she sent each photon.
2. Bob measures each photon randomly in one of the bases.
	1. Because of quantum mechanics, if Bob chooses the correct basis that matches Alice’s, he gets the right bit. If he chooses the wrong basis, he gets a random result. He records his measurement bases and results.
3. Bob and Alice then publicly discuss (over a classical channel) which bases they used for each photon (but **not** the bit values). They discard all cases where Bob guessed the wrong basis. The remaining cases, where bases matched, should give them a sequence of bits that are highly correlated – this is the raw key material.
4. Crucially, if an eavesdropper (Eve) was listening in and trying to intercept/measure the photons, her measurements would disturb the quantum states (due to the **Heisenberg uncertainty principle** and **no-cloning theorem**, which says you cannot copy an unknown quantum state without disturbing it). This disturbance introduces errors in the key. So, Alice and Bob now compare a subset of their key bits publicly to check for error rates. If the error rate is higher than what would be expected from normal noise, it suggests eavesdropping. If it’s low, they can proceed.
5. They then apply classical post-processing: **information reconciliation** (correcting any slight mismatches through error correction) and **privacy amplification** (compressing the key to eliminate any partial knowledge Eve might have gained, usually by hashing the key). The end result is a shared secret key that only Alice and Bob know, with high assurance no one intercepted it.
