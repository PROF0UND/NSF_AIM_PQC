- **Superposition:** A qubit can be in multiple states at the same time (until observed).
- **Entanglement:** Qubits can be correlated in a way that one’s state instantly influences the other, no matter the distance.
- a n-bit register can represent 2^[n] configurations at the same time.
- Quantum algorithms exploit this to solve certain problems much faster than classical algorithms by cleverly manipulating qubit states and using quantum **interference** to amplify correct results and cancel out wrong ones.

- NP problems: Very hard to solve by classical computers.
- BQP: Bounded-error quantum polynomial time. Solve np problems in polynomial time.

- No panicking right now since the quantum computers are still weak
- modern qc have only a few hundred noisy qubits and can factor small numbers.
- we would need **thousands of stable, error-corrected qubits** to do that job.
- one research estimate indicated around **1,730 logical qubits** (which might require millions of physical qubits with error correction) could factor a 2048-bit RSA number in about 8 hours.
- another= 20 million physical qubits to break RSA-2048 in a day.
