- encrypt data in fixed-size blocks, utilizing confusion and diffusion to enhance cryptographic security.
- Block ciphers transform fixed‑length plaintext blocks (e.g., 64 bits or 128 bits) into ciphertext blocks via a reversible keyed permutation.
- Messages longer than one block are handled via **modes of operation**
- This structure enables parallelization and strong mixing of bits.

## Confusion:
 - Ciphertext bits depend on complexity of the key.

## Diffusion:
- Changing one plaintext significantly changes the ciphertext.


> [[Stream Ciphers]] rely on _confusion_.

> Block Ciphers use both.

- makes it resilient.

## Padding and initialization Vector (IV):
- Block ciphers require padding to ensure block-size compatibility.
- Stream ciphers dont.
- Both may use IV
- IV is a unique random value for each encrytion.
- enhances security and ensures same plaintext doesnt give same ciphertext
- Proper IV management prevents patterns when encrypting identical plaintext with the same key multiple times
- When plaintext isn’t a multiple of the block size, padding schemes (e.g., PKCS#7, ANSI X9.23) append bytes to fill the final block.
- Padding must be unambiguously removable, and implemented carefully to avoid padding‑oracle attacks.

---
Two common techniques to bolster legacy ciphers:

1. **Multiple encryption** (e.g., double or triple DES).
    
2. **Key whitening**, XOR‑masking plaintext/ciphertext with extra subkeys.  
    
Both aim to increase effective key length and resist brute‑force attacks.

## **Average Time for Exhaustive Key Search**

- Key length determines brute‑force difficulty. 
- For a 56‑bit key (DES), a dedicated machine can search all keys in hours. 
- Modern ciphers use ≥ 128 bits, making exhaustive search physically impossible with current technology. ​
