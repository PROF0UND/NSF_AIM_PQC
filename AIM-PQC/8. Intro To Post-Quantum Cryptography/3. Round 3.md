## Final Showdown
- Final evaluation

1. [[Lattice-based]]:
	1. **Kyber, Saber, NTRU, Dilithium, Falcon**
	2. **Kyber and Saber slightly tweaked** a hash function in their KEM
	3. avoid any potential structured-output issues​ (this was a precaution, not due to an attack)
	4. Falcon had a known implementation challenge: it uses floating-point arithmetic for Gaussian sampling, which could be a side-channel leakage source.
	5. Researchers demonstrated a side-channel on Falcon (using electromagnetic emanations) to recover keys​. In response, implementers added masking to Falcon’s reference implementation to blunt this attack, at some performance cost.
	6. these issues noted by NIST
	7. Kyber, Dilithium, Falcon were front runners
	8. **Saber** and **NTRU** were also secure but NIST would likely pick only one primary KEM – it became a race primarily between Kyber vs Saber vs NTRU in performance and trust.
	9. Kyber had slight edge in speed and had wider analysis, which ultimately put it ahead.
2. [[multivariable polynomial]]:
	1. Rainbow
	2. BUT, Feb 2022 it was broken
	3. attacker could get the private key
	4. 022 attack by Beullens was devastating and sliced through Rainbow’s security claims.
	5. Disqualified
	6. Seeing Rainbow’s fall, many experts speculated (correctly) that NIST would take SPHINCS+ as the third signature algorithm to standardize (to ensure diversity).
	7. SPHINCS+ was under serious consideration
3. [[SPHINCS+]]:
	1. no attacks
	2. hard to attack a scheme that basically reduces to “break SHA256”.
4. **Alternate KEMs (BIKE, HQC, Frodo, NTRU Prime, SIKE):**
	1. frodo:
		1. key and ciphertext sizes
		2. speed bad
		3. plan C
	2. NTRU prime:
		1. secure
		2. designed by some cryptographers (like D. J. Bernstein et al.)
		3. NTRU Prime looked a bit redundant
	3. BIKE and HQC:
		1. BIKE uses an iterative decoder for QC-LDPC codes and there were some concerns about error leakage, but mitigations were in place.
		2. HQC uses Reed-Muller codes and was pretty solid
		3. Both still had larger public keys (~1-2 KB)
	4. **Classic McEliece (code-based finalist):** McEliece basically sat in its throne unchallenged
	5. **SIKE (isogeny alternate):** was broken


By mid-2022, the writing was on the wall: **Kyber** was the top choice for KEM, **Dilithium and Falcon** were top for signatures, and **SPHINCS+** would be included for diversity.
