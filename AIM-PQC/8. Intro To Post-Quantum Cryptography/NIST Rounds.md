Kyber won out among lattice KEMs due to its excellent performance, small key and ciphertext (768–1088 bytes range) for ~128-bit quantum security, and strong security analysis.

Thus, the NIST competition concluded with **4 primary algorithms** for immediate standardization (Kyber, Dilithium, Falcon, SPHINCS+) and plans to add a couple more (Falcon – which is already chosen but awaiting standard doc, and HQC as a new choice from the alternates). Classic McEliece remains unstandardized but known as a highly secure option (it might live on perhaps in niche applications or future standard if needed)
