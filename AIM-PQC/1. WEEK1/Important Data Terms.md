### **Confidentiality**

Confidentiality ensures that sensitive data remains private. Encryption techniques transform readable plaintext into ciphertext, viewable only by authorized users with the decryption key.

### **Integrity**

Integrity guarantees that data remains accurate and unaltered during storage or transmission. Techniques like hashing and digital signatures detect tampering, ensuring trustworthiness.

### **Real-World Application**

When you send sensitive data, like banking information, both confidentiality and integrity must be ensured to protect against cyber threats and maintain trust.

### **Authentication**

Authentication verifies identities in digital communication. It confirms that the sender is genuine and the message has not been forged.

Techniques include:

- Passwords
    
- Digital certificates
    
- Biometric verification
    

### **Non-Repudiation**

Non-repudiation ensures that a sender cannot deny sending a message. Cryptographic proofs like digital signatures provide legal and forensic evidence in disputes.

### **Practical Example**

Online banking transactions use both authentication and non-repudiation to ensure secure and traceable communications.

### **Plaintext**

Plaintext refers to data in its original, readable format. Before encryption, all messages exist as plaintext.

### **Codes**

Codes substitute words or phrases with predefined symbols to simplify communication. Examples include:

- Morse code
    
- Abbreviations like "ASAP"
    

While useful for simplification, codes alone are not sufficient for securing sensitive data. Cryptographic ciphers are required for secrecy.

### **Key Difference**

Unlike ciphers, codes rely on predefined dictionaries, making them easier to decipher without complex algorithms.

### **Cipher**

A cipher is a method or algorithm for converting plaintext into ciphertext. It systematically rearranges or substitutes characters to obscure the message's meaning.

### **Ciphertext**

Ciphertext is the encrypted output produced by applying a cipher to plaintext. Without the correct key and method, ciphertext appears as meaningless characters, securing the information within.

### **Importance**

Ciphers and ciphertext form the core of digital security, protecting emails, online transactions, and private messages from unauthorized access.

### **Key**

A key is the secret ingredient that enables encryption and decryption. It determines how the cipher transforms plaintext into ciphertext and back again.

### **Encryption & Decryption**

- **Encryption:** Converts plaintext to ciphertext using a cipher and key.
    
- **Decryption:** Reverses ciphertext back to readable plaintext using the same (or corresponding) key.
