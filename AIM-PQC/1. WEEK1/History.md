###  **Ancient Foundations**

- **Egypt (3300–3000 BC)** – Hieroglyphics used symbols to encode concepts and words.
    
- **Sparta (5th Century BC)** – The Scytale enabled Spartans to send secure messages on the battlefield.
    
- **Rome (100–44 BC)** – Julius Caesar famously employed a shift cipher for military communications.

### **Key Developments**

- **Symmetric Algorithms** – Where one key encrypts and decrypts.
    
- **Asymmetric Algorithms** – Involving a public and private key pair.
    
- **Hybrid Systems** – Combining the best of both symmetric and asymmetric methods.
