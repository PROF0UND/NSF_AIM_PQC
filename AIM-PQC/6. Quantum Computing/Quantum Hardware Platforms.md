1. Superconducting Qubits:
	- Used by IBM, Google
	- Fast gate speeds, relatively easy to manufacture
	- Require cryogenic cooling]
2. **Trapped Ions**
    - Used by IonQ, Quantinuum
    - Higher fidelity, longer coherence times
    - Slower gate speeds
3. **Photonic Qubits**
    - Used by Xanadu (Strawberry Fields)
    - Room temperature operation
    - Still experimental
4. **Topological Qubits**
    - Microsoftâ€™s long-term bet (Majorana fermions)
    - Promises better error resistance, but no working prototype yet
5. **Neutral Atoms and Spins**: Also gaining traction (e.g., QuEra)
