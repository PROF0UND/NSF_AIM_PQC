- usage of quantum mechanics such as entanglement, interference and superposition to perform computation.

## Superposition:

- a Qubit can exist as a _linear combination_ of 0 and 1.

- until measured, the state is "probabilistically both"

---
## Entanglement:

- Qubits can be correlated in such a way that measuring one instantly reveals the state of the other, no matter the distance.

## Interference

- Quantum states can **interfere** constructively or destructively.
    
- Key for amplifying correct paths in algorithms (e.g., Grover’s search)

## No-Cloning Theorem

- It’s impossible to copy an unknown quantum state.    
- Protects quantum information but limits classical-style backup.
