- DH relies on logarithmic problems
- Therefore is vulnerable.
- we chose KYBER one of the algorithms in the Cryptographic Suite for Algebraic Lattices (CRYSTALS) as a successor. [[Lattice-based]]
- KYBER is a [[Lattice-based]] key encapsulation algorithm based on hardness of solving the learning-with-errors problem over module lattices.
- one of the 4 public -key encryption and key-establishment algorithms.
