coined in the 1950 s to refer to all schemes developed **before large‑scale electronic computers**. These include:

- **Substitution ciphers**: Caesar/Shift, ROT n, Atbash, Vigenère, Playfair, etc.
    
- **Transposition ciphers**: Rail‑Fence, Route, Columnar, etc.

### **Why Study Them Today?**

- They reveal the **evolution of threat models**: from illiterate eavesdroppers to state‑level cryptanalysts.
    
- Many modern primitives (e.g., S‑boxes in AES) are automated forms of classical substitution.
    
- They train our intuition about **frequency analysis**, key space size, and brute‑force limits.
