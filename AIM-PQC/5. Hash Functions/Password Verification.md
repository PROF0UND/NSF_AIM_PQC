- the system receives the user‑entered password, computes its hash, and compares it to the stored hash.
- Because the salt is stored or derivable, this process remains deterministic.
- Robust implementations use slow hash functions (e.g., bcrypt, scrypt) to slow brute‑force attacks, balancing usability and security.
- lmaooo rage bait.
