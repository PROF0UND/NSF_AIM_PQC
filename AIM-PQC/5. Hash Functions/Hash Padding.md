- Input is padded before compression.
- eg: 512 or 1024 bits
- should be multiples of the block size.
- The padding scheme typically includes the original message length to prevent length-extension attacks.
- All hashes of the same variant yield identical digest lengths regardless of input size, supporting consistent storage and comparison .
