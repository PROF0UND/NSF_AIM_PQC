- NIST’s SHA‑0 (1993) and SHA‑1 (1995) produced 160‑bit digests but suffered weaknesses.
- In 2001, SHA‑2 emerged with variants SHA‑224, SHA‑256, SHA‑384, and SHA‑512, extending digest sizes and strengthening the compression schedule.
- SHA‑2 remains widely trusted for its robust security margin and resistance to known cryptanalytic attacks.

## SHA-3
- Recognizing structural similarities in SHA‑2 and legacy vulnerabilities, NIST held a contest culminating in Keccak’s selection as SHA‑3 (2012, FIPS 202, 2015).
- SHA‑3 uses a sponge construction, absorbing input into a permuting state and squeezing out the digest.
- complements SHA‑2 by providing an entirely different internal design and security assumptions.
