## Hash functions
- fundamental algorithms that map data of arbitrary size to fixed-length outputs, known as digests or hashes.
- serve as compact “fingerprints” for data, ensuring that even small changes to the input produce vastly different outputs.
- hash functions are crucial for data integrity checks, password storage, digital signatures, and more
- hash function must be deterministic, fast to compute, and exhibit strong randomness in its outputs while being resistant to various attacks such as collisions or preimage recovery.

## Motivation:
- Signing large messages directly with slow asymmetric algorithms imposes significant computational and bandwidth overhead.
- Without hashing, an attacker could remove, reorder, or splice message blocks and their signatures to forge new signed content.
- By first compressing the message into a short, fixed‑length hash and then signing just that digest, we achieve both efficiency and security: smaller signatures, reduced computational cost, and preserved integrity even for long messages.
