- Hash function H takes a variable‑length input M and outputs a fixed-size digest h = H (M)
- Ideal properties include uniform distribution (outputs appear random), avalanche effect (a one-bit change in M flips about half the bits of h), and one‑wayness (computationally infeasible to invert).
- From h, retrieving M is imfeasable.
- Do not use secret keys and are only one-way.
- This differentiates them from encryption algorithms.
