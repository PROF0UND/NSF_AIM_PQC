## Objectives:

1. Identify open ports
2. Basic port scanner with `sockets`
3. 

## Expectations:

- Tool should determine:
	- the service name
	- description of purpose
	- why it could be a risk
- outcome of the project is a list of open ports for a target website or host.
- for each open port:
	- Compare scanning (e.g., number of ports detected, scan duration, level of detail).
	- service name
	- description of port's function
	- risks
- code is just supposed to state which ports are open
