- **Mathematical Basis:** Discrete logarithms over elliptic curve groups.
    
- **Key Advantages:**
    
    - Shorter keys (160–256 bits) for equivalent security.
        
    - Faster computations, smaller signatures/ciphertexts.
        
- **Adoption:** Widely used in TLS, mobile devices, embedded systems.
