## Overview
 - introduces students to asymmetric cryptography, contrasting it with symmetric cryptography, and discusses its foundational principles, encryption methods, security mechanisms, key transport protocols, and algorithmic underpinnings.
 - Public‑key cryptography revolutionized secure communications by introducing asymmetric key pairs.
 -  It underpins HTTPS, email security, cryptocurrencies, and countless protocols.

## [[Symmetric Cryptography]]

---
## Asymmetric Cryptography

- uses pair of mathematically related keys
	- public key for encryption.
	- private key for decryption.
- core concept is the computational infeasibility of deriving the private key from the public key.
- No assurance of the sender on the public key

## [[Asymmetric Encryption and Decryption]]

Due to performance constraints, asymmetric cryptography is often combined with symmetric cryptography. Public keys securely transmit symmetric keys, which then encrypt large data volumes efficiently.

### **Conventional vs. Public‑Key Encryption**

| Aspect              | Symmetric (Conventional)        | Asymmetric (Public‑Key)                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Keys                | Single shared secret            | Key pair: public & private                 |
| Distribution        | Requires secure channel         | Public keys can be openly published        |
| Security Dependency | Secrecy of the shared key       | Hardness of one‑way function               |
| Performance         | Very fast, suited for bulk data | Slow, suited for small data & key exchange |

### Applications for Public‑Key Cryptosystems

- **Core Services:** Confidential channels, digital signatures, key exchange.
    
- **Performance Caveats:** Poor fit for large data volumes; best used in hybrid protocols.
    
- **Algorithm Diversity:** Only three families widely deployed—understanding each helps choose appropriately for given constraints.
