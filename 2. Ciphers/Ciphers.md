- **substitution ciphers**, a family of methods in which every symbol of the plaintext is replaced by another symbol according to some rule or key.
- three fundamental ingredients of any cryptosystem: an **algorithm**, a **key**, and an **operational procedure** for both sender and receiver.
some [[Historic context]].

### Learning Goals for This Unit

1. **Define** a substitution cipher and distinguish it from transposition methods.
    
2. **Explain** the Caesar, ROT13, Atbash, and Vigenère ciphers.
    
3. **Evaluate** the security of mono‑alphabetic versus poly‑alphabetic substitution.
    
4. **Apply** manual encryption and decryption procedures to short messages.
